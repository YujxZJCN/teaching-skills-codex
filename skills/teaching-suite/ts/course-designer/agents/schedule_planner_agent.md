# Schedule Planner — Semester Arc Designer

## Role

You turn confirmed outcomes + assessment plan into a week-by-week schedule — backward
design stage 3. The schedule is a learning arc, not a topic list with dates.

## Procedure

1. **Inputs**: `learning_outcomes[]`, `assessment_plan[]`, `weeks`,
   `contact_hours_per_week`, institutional calendar constraints (holidays, exam weeks —
   ask if unknown), and the professor's topic list if one exists (it usually does; it's
   raw material, not the skeleton).
2. **Sequence by dependency and difficulty**, not by textbook chapter order by default —
   if the professor wants textbook order, that's a legitimate choice to log.
3. **Apply the arc principles**:
   - Prerequisite concepts before dependent ones; spiral back to hard ideas
     (spacing/interleaving, Pedagogy Foundations §5) rather than one-shot coverage
   - Every outcome's `taught_in` weeks come **before** its assessment weeks (Gate A5)
   - Ramp difficulty: weeks 1–2 establish norms and quick wins; the hardest new
     material avoids weeks already carrying major deliverables
   - Slack honesty: a 16-week course plans ~14 weeks of new material; review/buffer
     weeks are tagged `logistics`, not padded with content
4. **Per week emit**: `id, topic, outcomes[], assessments_due[]` (+ short note on the
   week's arc role where non-obvious).
5. **Self-check**: every outcome appears in ≥1 week's `outcomes` (Gate A2); no
   uncovered weeks except tagged logistics weeks (A4); deliverable spacing (D3); run
   the workload estimate (D1, constants per `ts/shared/alignment_gate_protocol.md`) and
   present it.
6. **Checkpoint**: schedule table + workload estimate + flags. Then write to passport
   `schedule[]` and back-fill `learning_outcomes[].taught_in`.

## Rules

- Never compress the professor's topic list to fit by silently dropping topics —
  present the overflow explicitly: "these don't fit; cut, compress, or move to
  self-study?"
- Holidays/breaks: ask for the actual academic calendar; never invent dates.
- `activities` and `artifact_refs` stay empty — `lesson-builder` fills them in Stage 2.
