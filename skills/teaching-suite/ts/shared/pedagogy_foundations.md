# Pedagogy Foundations

The evidence base every skill in this suite designs against. Agents cite these principles
by name when justifying a recommendation, so the professor can see *why* — and overrule
with discipline knowledge the model lacks. This is a working reference, not a literature
review: each entry states the principle, the canonical source, and what it changes in
practice.

## 1. Backward design (Wiggins & McTighe, *Understanding by Design*, 2005)

Design in three stages: (1) identify desired results — learning outcomes; (2) determine
acceptable evidence — assessments; (3) plan learning experiences — lessons. Never start
from "what content do I want to cover" or "what activities sound fun."

**In practice:** course-designer always produces outcomes before schedule; the pipeline
refuses to build lessons (Stage 2) before outcomes and assessment plan exist (Stage 1).

## 2. Constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996; Biggs & Tang, 2011)

Outcomes, teaching activities, and assessments must form a closed triangle: every outcome
is taught and assessed; every assessment maps to an outcome; activities rehearse what the
assessment will demand. Misalignment — testing what wasn't taught, teaching what isn't
assessed — is the single most common structural defect in course design.

**In practice:** the Alignment Gate (Gate 1.5) machine-checks the triangle over the
Course Passport before any materials are built.

## 3. Bloom's revised taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001)

Six cognitive levels: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create. Outcomes
use measurable verbs at an intentional level ("explain," "design," "critique" — never
"know," "understand," "appreciate" as outcome verbs). Assessment difficulty should match
the outcome's level: an "analyze" outcome assessed only by recall items is misaligned.

**In practice:** every learning outcome in the Course Passport carries a `bloom_level`
tag; item writers check item level against outcome level.

## 4. Active learning (Freeman et al., 2014, PNAS 111:8410)

Meta-analysis of 225 studies: active learning raised exam performance ~6% and lecturing
increased failure rates 1.5× relative to active sections, across STEM disciplines.
Lecture is not eliminated — it is punctuated. Even 80-person lectures support
think-pair-share, peer instruction with polling, minute papers, and worked-example pauses.

**In practice:** lesson-builder defaults to interleaving at least one active segment per
20–25 minutes of lecture, scaled to class size and modality.

## 5. Retrieval practice & spacing (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006; Dunlosky et al., 2013)

Testing is a learning event, not just measurement. Low-stakes frequent retrieval
(quizzes, clicker questions, cumulative problem sets) outperforms re-reading and
highlighting. Spacing and interleaving beat massed practice.

**In practice:** assessment-architect favors frequent low-stakes assessment over a
midterm/final-only structure and flags weight distributions where one exam exceeds ~40%.

## 6. Transparency in assignment design (TILT — Winkelmes et al., 2016)

Assignments state Purpose (which outcome, why it matters), Task (what to do), and
Criteria (what good looks like, ideally with examples). Transparent design
disproportionately benefits first-generation and underrepresented students.

**In practice:** every project brief and major assignment template in this suite has
mandatory Purpose / Task / Criteria sections.

## 7. Universal Design for Learning (CAST UDL Guidelines 3.0)

Provide multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression by default,
rather than retrofitting accommodations. Captions, readable documents, varied assessment
formats, and flexible participation routes help everyone, not only students with
registered accommodations.

**In practice:** the Quality Gate (Gate 3.5) includes a UDL checklist pass over
materials and assessments.

## 8. Formative feedback (Hattie & Timperley, 2007)

Effective feedback answers three questions: Where am I going? How am I going? Where to
next? Feedback on the task and process outranks feedback on the self; grades without
comments produce little learning.

**In practice:** student-mentor's feedback writer structures comments as
goal → status → next step, and front-loads what to do next.

## 9. Cognitive load (Sweller, 1988; Mayer's multimedia principles)

Working memory is the bottleneck. Lessons: segment content, pair words with graphics,
cut decorative noise, use worked examples before open problems for novices, fade
scaffolding as expertise grows (expertise-reversal effect).

**In practice:** lesson-builder's slide outlines follow one-idea-per-slide and
signal-before-detail; lecture notes interleave worked examples with practice.

## 10. Assessment validity & reliability (classical test construction)

A test blueprint (content × cognitive-level matrix) precedes item writing. Items: one
construct per item, no double-barreled stems, plausible homogeneous distractors, no
trick wording. Rubrics: criteria are observable, levels are distinguishable, language
describes work rather than the student.

**In practice:** assessment-architect always builds the blueprint first and shows it at
a checkpoint before writing items.

## 11. Student evaluations are biased evidence (Boring et al., 2016; Uttl et al., 2017)

Student evaluation scores correlate weakly with learning and carry documented gender and
ethnicity biases. They are evidence of *student experience*, not a measurement of
teaching quality. Numeric averages on small samples are noise.

**In practice:** teaching-reflector triangulates evaluations with peer observation and
learning artifacts, reads comments thematically rather than averaging scalars, and
explicitly labels bias caveats in every evaluation analysis report.

## 12. AI-era academic integrity (post-2023 consensus practice)

Detection tools are unreliable and discriminate against non-native writers (Liang et
al., 2023); policy built on detection alone fails. Durable responses: assess process as
well as product, use in-class/oral/authentic components, state an explicit per-assignment
AI-use policy (permitted / permitted-with-disclosure / prohibited, with reasons), and
design assessments where AI assistance is either legitimately useful or structurally
limited.

**In practice:** see `ts/shared/ai_era_integrity.md` — the integrity audit in
assessment-architect and Gate 3.5 both apply it. A syllabus without an AI-use policy
fails the Quality Gate.

## How agents use this file

- Cite by section number ("per Pedagogy Foundations §2, this outcome is unassessed").
- These are defaults, not dogma. The professor's discipline expertise wins: when a
  professor overrules a principle, record the decision and move on — do not re-argue it
  at every checkpoint.
- Do not lecture the professor on pedagogy unprompted. Apply the principles in the
  artifacts; surface the citation only when explaining a flag or a non-obvious choice.
